# MyReads Project

MyReads makes it easy for you to keep track of books by allowing you keep book records. MyReads keeps track of books by organizing them into different categories:

* Currently Reading
* Want To Read
* Read

You can search for new books to add in, so you will never forget the books you have already read, or lose the books you want to read ever again!

To install the project:
* download the project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Project Purpose

MyReads Project was built as an assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The 
project is used to demonstrate understanding of the main principles of React by adding interactivity.

## Important
The backend server was supplemented by Udacity. The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
